## Project Description

The application allows users to observe the development of a population of organisms that compete for survival and resources in a virtual environment. The project demonstrates core principles of object-oriented programming using Java.

## Main Features

- Simulation of an ecosystem with diverse organisms
- Dynamic interactions between objects (organisms, food, obstacles)
- Inheritance and mutation mechanisms
- Graphical user interface
- Ability to configure simulation parameters

## Technologies

- Java
- JavaFX
- Maven
